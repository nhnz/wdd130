    <h2>Mdubane</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone. I am Nhlakanipho Mdumiseni Wiseman Nzama from Durban, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa. I am married to my eternal companion Praise and we a have one lovely daughter named Zanda. I am a big football(soccer) fan and my favorite team is Arsenal the best team in the world. On my spare time I love to play and watch football.</p>
    <p> I have been a member of the Church of Jesus of Latter-day Saints for 10 years now. I love the principles and doctrines taught in the Church, they form a path before me which I follow in my life. My favorite scripture passage is Mosiah chapters 2-6 the sermon given by King Benjamin to his people. I love it when he reminded his people to impart their susbances to the beggars and not chase them away because we are beggars in the sight of the Lord. </p>
    <p> I work as a Field Operator in an oil refining company. Before my current job I did civil engineering diploma now I am pursuing computer studies degree. I guess there is no limit to learning is what I believe. As the world is moving more towards using robotics instead of manual labor and AI is taking over in many industries, I was motivated to improve my skills so as to secure a good job in the future. I hope we all have a lovely time learning this semester. Good luck to everyone.  </p>
